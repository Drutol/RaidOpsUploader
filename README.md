# RaidOpsUploader
Small C# app for uploading data to website.

App makes POST requests to remote server running Ruby on Rails (https://github.com/Mordonus/RaidOpsWeb/blob/master/app/controllers/api_controller.rb)
and uploads big json data via streams.

It's pretty amateurish... but hey! It Works :D
